Condition Problem - Elza
	1. is called if there is an open parentheses. 
	2. evaluates the condition as a whole when the stack of parentheses is already empty.
	3. logic for syntax checking for conditions is Elza's algorithm	
		- you set the limitations.
		- you set what you can do.



Solution Sets:

a. The only thing that can precede an '{' is "else" and ')'
b. Not our problem
	1. function problem
	2. too complicated
c. An if-else stack
	- push stack and determine what type.
	- keep if open curly brace if, push
	- if pop close curly brace if, then else is allowed/possible. else, reset the flag.
d. The only thing that can precede an '(' is a keyword or not empty.
	- just check if curWord is empty.
